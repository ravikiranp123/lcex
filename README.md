# LeetCode Practice

**Solve LeetCode in your editor. Track progress. Run timed interviews.**

A VS Code and Cursor extension with problem browsing, template generation, inline example runners, XP and streak tracking, and timed interview workflows — with optional cloud sync.

Every save now surfaces four layers of inline feedback as ghost text on the relevant line: interview anti-pattern lint, a constraint-aware complexity budget (🟢/🟡/🔴), adversarial edge-case probes, and live example results. No popups; hover any decoration to read details or click "turn off" for that feature.

## Install

- **VS Code** — [Install from Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NikkyAmresh.leetcode-practice), or in the command palette:
  ```
  ext install NikkyAmresh.leetcode-practice
  ```
- **Cursor, VSCodium, and other OSS editors** — [Install from Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nikkyamresh/leetcode-practice)

The extension activates automatically when a workspace contains a `.leetcode` file.

## Quick Start

1. Open a folder in VS Code or Cursor.
2. Create a `.leetcode` file in the workspace root (an empty `{}` is enough).
3. Run **LeetCode: Sign In** from the command palette.
4. Open the **LeetCode** sidebar and pick a problem.
5. Click **Create File**, solve, then run with **LeetCode: Run Examples** or <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>.

## Features

- **Browse and solve** — Full problemset, study plans, curated problem lists, and Question of the Day in sidebar views. Rich problem webview with "Create File" in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C++, or Java.
- **Companies sidebar** — Browse problems grouped by 463 companies with per-company **frequency**, global **acceptance rate**, color-coded difficulty dots, and topics in the row tooltip. Click to open in the editor. Topics + companies are also surfaced inside the problem webview as collapsible chips. Toggle via `leetcodePractice.showCompanies`.
- **Inline feedback on save** — Every save runs all enabled features at once, rendered as ghost text on the relevant line with a trusted-markdown hover and a one-click "turn off" link per feature. No popups.
  - **Interview anti-pattern lint** — flags `mutate-input`, built-in `.sort()` on sorting problems, magic numbers (`26` / `128` / `1000000007`), and indented debug `print`/`console.log`/`System.out.println` across py/ts/js/cpp/java. Emits a real VS Code diagnostic (squiggle + Problems panel) and an inline hint. Suppressible per line with `// lcex-lint-ignore: <rule>`.
  - **Complexity budget** — parses the problem's `Constraints:` section, derives a target Big-O from the largest size cap, estimates loop nesting by indent, and paints 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴 on the function signature plus a `nest k× → O(nᵏ)` badge on each loop.
  - **Adversarial edge-case probes** — turns parsed constraints into candidate edge cases (empty, single, max-size, boundary values, negatives, zeros, charset / sorted / distinct flags) and surfaces them inline on the signature. Advisory in this release.
  - **Run examples on save** — parses `// Expected:` / `# expected:` comments and diffs against `console.log` / `print` output; results render inline as `✓` or `✗ expected X · got Y` with a dedicated timeout message for >15s runs. Also available on-demand.
- **Run in terminal** — Execute the current solution file end-to-end in the integrated terminal.
- **Progress tracking** — Solved / attempting / cleared states, daily streaks, XP and levels, daily goals, and a stats dashboard with trends.
- **Interview mode** — Ad-hoc timed sessions (45 / 60 / 180 min) or planned `.lcInterview` mocks. Focus layout hides hints; each attempt produces a `.lcireport` snapshot.
- **Solution notes and agent actions** — Capture notes in `.hint` files; trigger **Make Runnable**, **Hint**, and **Explain My Code** from the editor. The `Hint` action writes a JSON sidecar (`~/.lcex/hint-context/<slug>.json`) with the static complexity estimate, parsed problem-size budget, verdict, and top hotspot, so the **lcex-dsa-hint** skill tailors the nudge to what you actually wrote.
- **DSA practice loop** *(opt-in, all off by default)* — Five features that go beyond "did your sample pass?":
  - **Spaced-repetition bug review** (`leetcodePractice.bugReview.enabled`) — failing examples are snapshotted to `~/.lcex/bug-reviews.json` and resurface as re-attempt drills 3 / 7 / 30 / 90 days later; status bar shows `N reviews due`.
  - **Differential fuzzer** (`leetcodePractice.fuzzer.enabled`) — define `bruteForce` + `fuzzInputs(seed)` alongside your solution; the fuzzer reports the first divergence as a counterexample (and snapshots it to the SR queue if bug-review is on).
  - **Empirical complexity fitter** (`leetcodePractice.empiricalFit.enabled`) — define `benchmark(n)`; the fitter times your solution at growing N, fits eight candidate curves, and flags when empirical complexity exceeds the static estimate.
  - **Recursion call-tree visualizer** (`leetcodePractice.recursionTree.enabled`) — define `traceCall()`; the visualizer instruments your recursive function and renders the live call tree with **memo-hit edges** (the exact cells memoization would skip).
  - **Iterative traversal visualizer** (`leetcodePractice.iterativeVisualizer.enabled`) — wrap your stack/queue with `lcexTrace.track(container, "stack"|"queue")` (or `lcex_trace.track(...)` in Python) inside `traceCall()`; the harness records every push/pop and renders the DFS/BFS traversal tree with **revisit edges** (cycles, redundant work).
  - TS / JS / Python today; C++ is phase-2.
- **Workspace config editor** — Custom editor for `.leetcode` files makes study plan, problem list, language, and file-naming overrides a UI action.
- **Cloud sync (optional)** — Sign in with Google to push and pull stats across machines via Firebase. Fully optional; the extension works offline without it.

## Known Limitations

**Cloudflare 403 Errors:** LeetCode uses Cloudflare to protect its legacy REST APIs (`runCode` and `submitCode`). If you consistently receive "Just a moment..." 403 errors when trying to run or submit code from within the extension, this is because Cloudflare is blocking the Node.js network request. In this case, please use the official **LeetCode** or **LeetCode Debug** extensions to run and submit your code.

## Privacy & anonymous analytics

The extension can send **anonymous, bucketed usage analytics** to Firebase to
help prioritise which features to improve. This is opt-outable at any time.

**What is sent:**
- A pseudonymous per-install UUID (generated on first launch, never linked to your identity).
- Which feature you used (e.g. `run_examples`, `interview_start`, `agent_hint`).
- Where it was triggered (command palette, sidebar, webview…).
- Coarse dimensions: language bucket (`ts`/`js`/`py`/`cpp`/`java`), difficulty bucket (`E`/`M`/`H`),
  duration bucket (`0_5m` / `5_15m` / `15_60m` / `60m+`), count bucket.
- Extension version, VS Code version, OS platform, locale, local hour of day.

**What is never sent:**
- Your uid, email, LeetCode username, or session cookie.
- Problem slugs, titles, descriptions, notes, or any code.
- File paths, workspace names, or folder names.
- Exact timestamps, error messages, stack traces.

**How it's protected:**
- Analytics events live in a separate Firestore collection (`/logs`).
  Security rules restrict reads to a single admin uid — **no user, including you,
  can read logs back**. Writes are strictly schema-validated: only enum values
  from an allow-list are accepted.
- Requires sign-in to cloud sync. If you're not signed in, nothing is sent.
- Respects the VS Code `telemetry.telemetryLevel` setting. If VS Code telemetry
  is off, analytics is off too.

**Opt out:**
- Run `LeetCode: Toggle anonymous analytics`, or
- Set `leetcodePractice.analytics.enabled` to `false` in settings, or
- Set VS Code's `telemetry.telemetryLevel` to `off`.

## Workspace Config (`.leetcode`)

Any setting above can be overridden per-workspace in the `.leetcode` file. Workspace values take precedence over user settings.

```json
{
  "studyPlans": [
    { "slug": "top-interview-150", "name": "Top Interview 150" },
    { "slug": "my-custom-list", "name": "My Custom List", "path": "data/custom-list.json" }
  ],
  "problemLists": [{ "slug": "graph", "name": "Graph" }],
  "activeStudyPlan": "top-interview-150",
  "activeProblemList": "graph",
  "language": "typescript",
  "fileNamePattern": "id",
  "defaultDirectory": "."
}
```

### Custom Study Plans

You can load your own custom-categorized study plans (like NeetCode 150) without relying on LeetCode's backend. 

Simply add the `path` property to a study plan entry in your `.leetcode` config and point it to a local JSON file in your workspace:

```json
{
  "Arrays & Hashing": ["contains-duplicate", "valid-anagram"],
  "Two Pointers": ["valid-palindrome"]
}
```

The extension will read this JSON file and instantly render it in the Study Plans sidebar as a fully categorized tree view.

## Requirements

- VS Code or Cursor **1.85+**
- Node.js — for TypeScript / JavaScript execution
- Python 3 — optional, for Python solutions
- A C++ toolchain — optional, for C++ solutions
- A JDK (`javac` + `java`) — optional, for Java solutions

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run compile         # or: npm run watch
npm test                # integration test against LeetCode API
npm run package         # produces a .vsix
npm run install-extension
```
